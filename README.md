# my_MEC_program
I build this Mobile Edge Computation simulating environment all by myself, and use the customized ddpg reinforcement learning algorithm to make the offloading decision.
The DDPG reinforcement learning decision algorithm was mostly from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yd5WnYls_Y, while some adjustments were made to fit the MEC environment.
BTW simulate.py is the file that you want to run.
